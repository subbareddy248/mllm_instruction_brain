# Brain Activity Prediction

In this task, we will take embeddings from pre-trained instruction-based models and train a linear regressor to take 
these embeddings and output the corresponding brain activity (fMRI).

**Hypothesis**: Here, we would like to use multimodal models because they _should_ be more aligned with our brain.
